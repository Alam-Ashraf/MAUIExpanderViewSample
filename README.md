In this article, I’m going to show you how to use Expander in Dot Net MAUI Community Toolkit.

The Xamarin.CommunityToolkit Expander view provides an expandable container to host any content. It has two main properties to store your content that is Header & Content. User can show or hide its content by interacting with the header of the control.

Expander has “Direction” property which defines the expander direction.

 ## ExpandDirection :
“Down” => It indicates that the Expander content is under the header.

“Up” => It indicates that the Expander content is above the header.

  ### Note : Expander is not supported inside CollectionView or ListView. May be in future version of .NET MAUI Community Toolkit will support.
